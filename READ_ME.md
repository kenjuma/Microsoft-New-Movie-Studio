Microsoft New Movie Studio

This repository contains the code and materials for the Microsoft's Movie Studio project, part of the curriculum for the Data Science Career Track by Flatiron School.
Overview

Microsoft has decided to create a new movie studio and wants to explore what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office. The goal of this project is to identify the key factors that contribute to the success of movies and provide actionable insights to help the head of Microsoft's new movie studio decide what type of films to create.

Business Understanding

Microsoft is seeking to diversify their business portfolio by creating an original video content production studio. The company recognizes the growing demand for quality film content and intends to capitalize on this trend by investing in the creation of feature films. However, the company has limited knowledge of the film industry and is seeking insights to guide their decision-making process. The primary objective of this project is to identify the factors that contribute to the success of a movie at the box office, with a focus on understanding the characteristics of the most successful movie studios and how their budgets impact their performance. Ultimately, these findings will inform Microsoft's decision-making process and help them to produce films that resonate with audiences and achieve commercial success.

Stakeholders and Key Business Questions

The stakeholders of this project are the head of Microsoft's new movie studio, the marketing team, and the production team. The key business questions are:
•	What are the most successful movie studios in the industry, and how do they achieve success?
•	How does the budget of a movie affect its performance at the box office?
•	What is the impact of genre, rating, and release date on a movie's success?

Data Understanding and Analysis

The data for this project was obtained from Box Office Mojo, IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes, and TheMovieDB. The following files were used:

•	imdb.db
•	rt.movie_info.tsv.gz
•	rt.reviews.tsv.gz
•	tmdb.movies.csv.gz
•	tn.movie_budget.csv.gz
The data was cleaned and processed using Python and the following libraries: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Sqlite3. The data analysis includes exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and predictive modeling.

Business Recomendations

Focus on creating blockbuster movies: The top 10 studios by total gross revenue are all major players in the film industry, producing high-budget movies with big-name actors and directors. Microsoft's new movie studio should focus on creating blockbuster movies with broad appeal, rather than niche or art-house films.
Partner with established studios: Creating successful movies requires expertise and resources that Microsoft's new movie studio may not have on their own. They should consider partnering with established studios, such as the top studios by total gross revenue listed above, to leverage their expertise and resources.
Foreign gross revenue is more than domestic gross revenue: The pie chart shows that foreign gross revenue accounts for a larger proportion of total revenue than domestic gross revenue
